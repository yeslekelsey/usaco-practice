# usaco-practice
submitting my solutions for official usaco problems as practice for the u.s. open contest in march.<br>
all the problems i do will be solved in c++<br>
i will probably organize this further as i solve more problems.<br><br>

currently, i'm only solving <b>bronze</b> problems as that is the division i'm in, and i will try to prioritize more recent problems as they will reflect what could be on the u.s. open contest better.<br><br>
